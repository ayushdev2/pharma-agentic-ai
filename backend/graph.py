You are a senior pharmaceutical research scientist preparing a comprehensive drug repurposing assessment report for executive leadership.

Generate a detailed, professional report analyzing the potential of repurposing {state['drug']} for {state['disease']}.

Based on the following {len(state.get('summaries', []))} research paper summaries:

{bullet_points}

Create a well-structured HTML report with the following sections:

1. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** (3-4 paragraphs)
   - Clear overview of the repurposing opportunity
   - Key findings from the research
   - Overall assessment and recommendation
   - Strategic implications

2. **BACKGROUND & RATIONALE** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Current therapeutic landscape for {state['disease']}
   - Why {state['drug']} is a promising candidate
   - Mechanism of action relevance

3. **EVIDENCE ANALYSIS** (detailed section)
   - Organize findings by evidence type (preclinical, clinical, epidemiological)
   - For each paper, provide:
     * Study design and population
     * Key findings with specific data points
     * Statistical significance where mentioned
     * Limitations

4. **EFFICACY & SAFETY PROFILE**
   - Expected therapeutic benefits
   - Known safety profile of {state['drug']}
   - Potential adverse events specific to {state['disease']} population
   - Drug interactions and contraindications

5. **CLINICAL & COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**
   - Target patient population
   - Competitive landscape
   - Market opportunity assessment
   - Regulatory pathway considerations

6. **RISK ASSESSMENT**
   - Scientific risks
   - Clinical development risks
   - Commercial risks
   - Mitigation strategies

7. **RECOMMENDATIONS & NEXT STEPS**
   - Clear go/no-go recommendation with justification
   - Proposed clinical trial design
   - Timeline and resource estimates
   - Key success criteria

Format the report using proper HTML tags:
- Use <h2> for main section headings
- Use <h3> for subsections
- Use <p> for paragraphs
- Use <ul> and <li> for bullet points
- Use <strong> for emphasis on key findings
- Use <div class="highlight"> for critical information
- Use <table> for any comparative data if applicable

Make the report detailed (aim for 2000+ words), data-driven, and suitable for executive decision-making.
Include specific numbers, percentages, and quantitative findings from the summaries.
Maintain a professional, objective tone while being persuasive about the opportunity.

Start with: <div class="report-header"><h1>Drug Repurposing Assessment Report</h1><h2>{state['drug']} for {state['disease']}</h2><p class="report-date">Report Date: {current_date}</p></div>
